an event in javascript can be classifies into two types:-
1. Browser Specific Event   [ resing browser window, scroling up & down ] 
2. DOM specific Event   [ clicking a button, hovering over an elemnt, focus on a textbox]



How to handle events in javascript
 1. inline event handler
 2. event handler properties
 3. using addEventListener() methods



Using inline event hanlder, we can handle DOM event by:-
1. Adding an attribute to the HTML element for which we want to handle event
2. The attribute name must be the (on + eventname) like [ onclick, onfocus, onmousehover ]
3. Assign any javascript expression to the attribute which you want to execute when that event happens

# example
<input type = "text" id = "fname"/>
# adding inline event handler, we are handling focus event handler
<input type = "text" id = "fname" 
onfocus="this.style.backgroundColor='yellow'"  #this -> point to text field
onblur="this.style.backgroundColor='white'"/>





 Using event handler properties, we can handle DOM event by:-
 1. Adding a DOM property to the DOM element for which we want to handle event
 2. The property name must be (on + eventname)
 3. Assigning a javascript function to the property which we to execute when the event happens

 let lName = document.getElementById('id')
 lName.onfocus = function () {
    lName.style.backgroundColor = "yellow"
 }

 lName.onblur = function () {
    lName.style.backgroundColor = "balckj"
 }
